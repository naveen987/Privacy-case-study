"What common compliance issues are identified in the dataset, and how frequently do they occur?","The report identifies a minor BEP20 compliance issue, which is not uncommon, as it occurs frequently.","that, we examine a few identified issues of varying severities that need to be brought up and paid
more attention to. (The findings are categorized in the above table.) Additional information can be
found in the next subsection, and the detailed discussions are in Section 4.

2.2 Key Findings
Overall, a minor BEP20 compliance issue was found and our detailed checklist can be found in","far, we have identiﬁed a list of potential issues: some of them involve subtle corner cases that might
not be previously thought of, while others refer to unusual interactions among multiple contracts.
For each uncovered issue, we have therefore developed test cases for reasoning, reproduction, and/or
veriﬁcation. After further analysis and internal discussion, we determined a few issues of varying"

High Risk
The issue puts a large number of users’ sensitive information
at risk, or is reasonably likely to
lead to catastrophic impact for
client’s reputation or serious
financial implications for client
and users.
Medium Risk","12Conclusion 
We performed the procedures as laid out in the scope of the audit and 
there were 2 ﬁndings, 1 medium and 1 low. The medium risk issues do 
not pose a security risk as they are best practice issues that is why the 
overall risk level is low."
